## Project Name:
 ### MyHelperNg

 #### Description

MyHelpNg is a platform that aims to connect volunteers seeking to offer their skills/expertise and time with NGOs/charity organizations that needs those skills/services. 

We make it easy for nonprofits to clearly communicate their needs, and for people to give their time, skills or funds in the most effective way possible. By volunteering online, donating funds or even just hitting the “Share” button – supporting great causes can take many shapes and forms, and we’re here to make it all possible.

From research most NGO organisations lack sufficient man power and necessary resources to carry out thier goals and reach out to communities in need of help/relief. MyHelperNg aims to bridge the gap by providing a platform where these organisations can get help from volunteers willing to offer their skills and also get Donations from willing donors and philanthropists online.
